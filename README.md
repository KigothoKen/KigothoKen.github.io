# Pig Health Diagnostic Tool üê∑

An AI-powered application for diagnosing pig health conditions through image analysis and symptom recognition. This tool helps farmers and veterinarians quickly identify common pig diseases and receive treatment recommendations.

## Features üåü

- **Image-based Disease Detection**: Upload images of pigs for AI-powered disease detection
- **Symptom Analysis**: Input observed symptoms to receive accurate diagnoses
- **8 Disease Coverage**: Detects and provides information about common pig diseases:
  - Swine Flu
  - PRRS (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome)
  - Foot and Mouth Disease
  - Pneumonia
  - Swine Dysentery
  - Sarcoptic Mange
  - Swine Erysipelas
  - Porcine Parvovirus
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Get detailed treatment suggestions and preventive measures
- **User-friendly Interface**: Modern, responsive design for easy use on any device

## Model Architecture üß†

The disease detection model is built using MobileNetV2 architecture with transfer learning:

- Base Model: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- Additional Layers:
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Dense Layer (1024 units, ReLU)
  - Dropout (0.5)
  - Dense Layer (512 units, ReLU)
  - Output Layer (8 units, Softmax)
